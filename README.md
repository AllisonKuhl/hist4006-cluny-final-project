I am making a game about the abbey of Cluny! 


## How to Play

I am sure you are wondering how to play this game. Okay, I will do my best to tell you. (and if you know a better way let me know). First of all, you need to have python installed, version 3.4 or higher. Next, download the repository. Really all you need is the file with "monk simulator 2.0" but I haven't found a way to only download one file? Once you've done that, go to wherever you saved everything and click on "code", then "monk simulator". Click "monk simulator 2.0" for the latest version of the game, but if you want you can play the older version as well. Once you are in the Monk Simulator 2.0 file, click on "main.py". If you are lucky, it should work from here. But it might not. If it opens in python idle or some other python terminal, try hitting "run" and it might go. 

The alternative way is open your command line or terminal. Use the change directory command (cd) to move to the directory where you are storing the main file. Type: python main.py. Then it should run as long as you have everything set up on your computer right. 

Well, give it a try and tell me what works and what doesn't.

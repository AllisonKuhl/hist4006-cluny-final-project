I am making a game about the abbey of Cluny! 

## About this Project

This game served as my final project for my 4th year history seminar on the Abbey of Cluny in fall 2015/winter 2016. There are several versions of the game, as I struggled to find the best way to present the history of the abbey, and the lives of monks in general, into a game that is both informative and educational.

My first attempt is here: https://github.com/AllisonKuhl/hist4006-cluny-final-project/tree/master/code/monk-simulator/monk-beta-1.
It is the most rudimentary and simplest. It is just a loop; days pass by and you have to do the required tasks over and over. While arguably this is a good represenation of live as a monk, on the other hand it is not very fun. So I decided to change things. 

Here is my second attempt: https://github.com/AllisonKuhl/hist4006-cluny-final-project/tree/master/code/monk-simulator/monkSimulator2.0
This game incoroporates rooms, giving an important sense of exploration and adventure that I feel makes things a bit more exciting. This version, however, is not complete as I started this near the end of the semester. I am hoping to someday complete this when I have more time. I have big plans to add an interesting story line, as well as side quests and mini-games.

Eventually, I want to get the game to work as a web app using javascript and html5 canvas. I have experimented with one small mini-game here: https://github.com/AllisonKuhl/hist4006-cluny-final-project/tree/master/code/chantGame, but I hope to add more later.

## How to Play

This is here to help my classmates and any other people who might want to play this game. First of all, you need to have python installed, version 3.4 or higher. Next, download the repository. Really all you need is the file with "monk simulator 2.0" but I haven't found a way to only download one file? Once you've done that, go to wherever you saved everything and click on "code", then "monk simulator". Click "monk simulator 2.0" for the latest version of the game, but if you want you can play the older version as well. Once you are in the Monk Simulator 2.0 file, click on "main.py". If you are lucky, it should work from here. But it might not. If it opens in python idle or some other python terminal, try hitting "run" and it might go. 

The alternative way is open your command line or terminal. Use the change directory command (cd) to move to the directory where you are storing the main file. Type: python main.py. Then it should run as long as you have everything set up on your computer right. 

Well, give it a try and tell me what works and what doesn't.

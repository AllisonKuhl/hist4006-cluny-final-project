So this is a quick simulation I made in order to test and practise some things.
I didn't do any research or anything so it's probably not very... historical I guess?

But mainly I just wanted to experiment with coding a simple game in python, as well as using some things I haven't used before (objects, mainly).
I also wanted to try out random events, since I think I'll be using that a lot in my game. 
I'm not entirely happy with how I did it in this game - it looks kinda messy and inefficient, but hopefully I can finetune it later on. 

Anyway I encourage you all to take a look at the source code even if you can't understand everything. 
I tried to comment it in order to make things clearer but I'm not sure if it's helpful. 
If you have any questions about what things do, let me know. 
Basically, the game lets you grow three arbitrary varieties of plants
(only differences is grow time and final harvest, which again are completely arbitrary)
and it will grow well or not depending on the weather. 
Sometimes random events will happen.
Your goal is to get enough food to survive the winter! 

Let me know if you have any suggestions to make it better. 
I don't know if I'll include this in the final game, it was more just to try things out. 

In order to play, just download the source file. 
Then as long as you have python installed on your computer, you should just be able to click on the file and it will run. 
I think.

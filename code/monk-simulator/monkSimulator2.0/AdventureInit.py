This open-air space is the centre of the abbatial palace, formerly the atrium to the second church of Peter and Paul (Cluny II). Around you visitors and monastic officers speak and negotiate. The possibility of failing to keep your proper monastic silence and equanimity seems greater in this mundane space.")

You rejoice in the great vision of Saintly Odilo, who rebuilt the cloister and turned the space into a veritable new Eden. In summer time, you find nothing more enjoyable than to soak up the warmth of the sun on your face and tend the medicinal or culinary herbs that grow in their neatly arranged beds.  In winter, the rain makes it less hospitable, but the gardens still fill with greenery except from Advent until Epiphany. With books in hand, monks will often sit on the low wall in between the brilliant marble pillars supporting the open galleries running alongside the surrounding buildings. At the south-east end of the cloister a single monk looks down from the dormitory landing. In the south-west corner of the cloister is the covered washing fountain, bubbling with water fed from a nearby spring. This is where all the monks wash and cleanse themselves before mass and before entering the refectory.")

It is in this space that the monks gather to hear the Rules of the monastery and discuss monastery business.
